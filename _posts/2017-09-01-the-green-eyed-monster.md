There are many opinions on the internet about the subtle differences between envy and jealousy. For this article, do yourself a favour and just roll with my definition: I mean wishing for something because another person has it. Not wishing it away from them, but wishing a copy for yourself.

> O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;  
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock  
The meat it feeds on  
_Shakespeare's Othello (3.3.166-68)_

Shakespeare's observations of human nature are timeless. This particular example notes that jealousy makes a fool of its prey: a jealous person is a foolish person; jealousy is foolish. Jealousy gets in the way of friendship, for example. It also contradicts contentment, joy, peace, patience, love, gentleness -- actually, most of the fruit of the Spirit now that I look at it. Jealousy is in opposition to the Spirit of God. 

Lately, I've noticed myself becoming more jealous. I don't like it. I'm going to name and shame it, reject it, and hopefully kick the habit (with God's help).

A list of the ridiculous things I've been jealous about, in no particular order:

- that my acquaintances have friends
- that other people have social lives
- that my couple-friends are certain they enjoy spending time together
- that my engaged friends cry on their fianc√©es' shoulders
- that some people live in family-units
- that blog authors are able to express insight
- that my colleagues are skilled at their work
- that university students stay out late with friends
- that teachers spend their days with lively children
- that shift-workers and part-timers can choose to spend their afternoons outside
- that fellow-Christians live generously
- that part-timers have energy to spend at their discretion
- that some people want to go travelling overseas
- that some people have a career plan

In general, I'm jealous that other people have certainty, community, and purpose. These are areas where I am conscious of a deficit at the moment.

Father God, thank you that you teach us to pray "Give us today our daily bread". Thank you for always giving us enough energy, encouragement and resources to live each day; thank you for your sustenance.

Lord God, thank you for all the gifts you have given us beyond what we need for survival. I live in a safe, honest, and beautiful country. I belong to a family that loves each other. I am part of a flat that cares for each other. I work for a company that respects its employees. I experience the joy of charitable giving. I can think; I can move; I can understand and be understood by others.

And the biggest blessing of all, let's not forget, is that we know God and our sins are forgiven because of Jesus Christ.

Take a moment to count your blessings. Go on.
