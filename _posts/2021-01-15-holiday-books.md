Here we are again for *Unqualified Book Reviews, Edition Three*. Today on the menu we have a selection of light-hearted and serious fare, a reflection of my Christmas season. While everybody else see this as a relaxed break away from the daily grind, I entered summer with the hope of getting to spend time with people and do things -- this was going to be my busy season. As things unfolded, everybody else wanted to kick back and do nothing (fancy that! who could have guessed!)... so I picked up some more brain-intensive books. And some others...

# The Night Circus (Erin Morgenstern)
*alternative-reality magic love family light darkness*

I definitely read this late last year but it seems to have been omitted from both my previous lists. It defies every genre by cleverly distorting realism with enchantment, mixing coming-of-age romance with political thriller. Reading this for the first time felt like a fascinating journey through unfamiliar country on your way home. Award-winning material. Recommended to all who can appreciate a good story with a touch of magic.

# Ready Player One (Ernest Cline)
*sci-fi virtual-reality dystopia underdogs capitalism social-commentary young-adult video-game*

I had just started reading this as an e-book when I wrote the last reviews. I changed from my backlit phone to a proper e-ink reader which was a definite upgrade for my eyes.

As a novel, *Ready Player One* is artfully constructed so that you know exactly where the story will end but you keep reading to find out how the characters get there. There are just enough main characters to make it feel like a community without being a test of memory. 

Like all good dystopias, the world is eerily recognisable as our own. In this case there was no World War Three, just a gradual degradation until the yawning gap between the rich and poor became the primary characteristic of society. Technology -- or more specifically, an immersive virtual reality called the OASIS -- is hailed as the great equaliser and salvation of the economy. But as in our own world, a person's ability to access and succeed in technology is largely dependent on their inherited poverty or wealth. Ready Player One points a sharp finger at the escapism video game industry and asks us to consider its real-world side effects.

A week after reading the book, I watched Steven Spielberg's movie of the same name. It is an absolutely brilliant example of adaptation: the same characters dwell in a setting and story reimagined for the visual medium. For example, in the movie we watch the characters in the real world travel in a moving vehicle, while their avatars in the virtual world experience the same physical forces. Such parallelism shines in the movie format.

The book and the movie are both masterpieces. Experience both.

# The Name of the Wind (Patrick Rothfuss)
*medieval fantasy storytelling song troubadour minstrel journey university magic*

Another masterpiece of story, this epic tale is related as an oral retelling of the protagonist's unlikely backstory. Interruptions from various listeners add to the ambience: I felt myself to be among the small crowd in that dim village pub enraptured by an old man's youthful adventures as the storm raged outside. 

As for his adventures, they range from a happy gypsy childhood to... well, you'll see. As he grows into a man he will experience many different living conditions and form many significant friendships and mentorships. By the end of the book I had made many new friends, too.

Well-written, "a good yarn". Apparently there are more books in the series but I was satisfied with just this one. A cosy escape from the 21st century to wilder times.

# Letters to Malcolm (C S Lewis)
*prayer God ideas church tradition liturgy personal letters*
I'll admit I skim-read this one. In the format of written letters addressed to an imaginary friend called Malcolm, Lewis reflects on Christian prayer with all the caveats of personal correspondence. This work is notable for Lewis' uncharacteristic refusal to claim certainty. He explores the interactions between human and divine agency, will, and desire according to the orthodoxy of the Bible, church tradition, and his own personal experience. I was reminded of Phillip Yancey's book on Prayer. In conclusion: we don't have all the answers -- not even half! -- but God is good and prayer is necessary.

# The Secret Diary of Lizzie Bennet (Bernie Su & Kate Rodrick)
*fan romance American multimedia diary classic-reimagined*

In 1813, Jane Austen published a novel *Pride and Prejudice*. In 2012-13, Hank Green and Bernie Su created a vlog web-series *The Lizzie Bennett Diaries* which got pretty famous. Yes, I watched it. So did several of my friends... so when I was helping one of said friends move house, and discovered this in a box of books, I naturally asked to borrow it. As expected, it's on the lighter end of light entertainment and clearly exists to monetise nostalgia in the grand tradition of branded merchandise. Nevertheless, I got several good chuckles out of it and ended up reading most of the good parts out loud to another fellow fan of the series. Not really worth it. Watch the web-series instead.

# Mere Christianity (C S Lewis)
*radio-transcript apologetics Christianity pop-theology*

I admit I procrastinated this for several months and then skim-read most of it. C. S. Lewis is a master of helpful illustrations but there are so many I struggle to remember any. 

My general impression: there are many denominations, brands, and celebrities of Christianity. At the core of all of them is Jesus Christ: God incarnate, our Saviour. To be Christian is to be "in Christ": by his death we have been forgiven, by his resurrection we are being re-formed, and by his ascension we will be welcomed by our Father in heaven.

I was impressed by Lewis' flat refusal to engage with theological differences within the church. I appreciate his straight-talking exposition of the truth that really matters.

# The Summer of Impossible Things (Rowan Coleman)
*family time-travel love hope grief parents*

An apparently ordinary novel about a broken family uses time travel to connect the generations and build connection. Sad but hopeful, filled with grief for past injustice but also gratitude for the small things that matter. Very difficult topics (trigger warning: abuse) handled with sensitivity and hard-won wisdom. Heart-breaking and heart-warming. 

# To China With Love (Hudson Taylor)
*autobiography missionary cross-cultural faith prayer obedience discipleship pioneer*

I had heard the name of Hudson Taylor, but that's about it. I now understand he is widely celebrated as the first missionary to China (1853). I was surprised (and convicted by my surprise) to discover that Hudson's faith and works were deeply established as a young adult in England, before he even considered the missionary vocation. This was a man who knew his God, and delighted in serving Him, every day of his life. Yes, there were ups and downs. He vividly recalls the occasions where his faith was tested. For example, after donating his last coin to a poor woman he still owed his own landlady rent and relied on God in prayer to provide the necessary money. In chorus with many thousands of other faithful Christians over the centuries (*Nevertheless* by Christians Against Poverty UK comes to mind), Hudson Taylor testifies that God always provides money, shelter, food, and encouragement in his perfect timing. 

Hudson's testimony indirectly calls each reader to live in prayer, rely on God for our daily bread, and obey the Word of God. I need not wait for a thunderbolt from heaven to start anything; God reveals himself and his will through the Bible and the life of Jesus Christ. Our mission is clear: preach the gospel and serve the poor. What are we waiting for?

# The Alchemist (Paulo Coelho, translated by Alan R. Clarke)
*allegory desert wisdom success*

Even after translation, the incredibly poetic words and desert setting create a vast and beautiful arena in which to explore ideas of happiness, success, and the purpose of life. A young shepherd boy, Santiago, apprentices himself to an older man Melchizedek, king of Salem, in the hope of learning the ancient art of alchemy, the way to convert iron into gold. At first he is attracted by wealth, but as the adventure continues and his patience is stretched into something resembling wisdom, he begins to see that there is more to life than comfort and riches, more than knowledge and power.

The author's worldview is clearly expounded in the voice of the old man: everyone is born with a *personal legend*, "what you have always wanted to accomplish," and it is your lifelong duty to the universe to accomplish it. In addition, "when you really want something to happen, the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true." In short, the purpose of your life is to achieve your childhood dreams, and the universe wants to help. For a church library book, I found this curiously hedonistic and atheistic. For a short while it motivated me like all self-help books, but in a matter of days the ridiculous premise wore off. Perhaps I have not adequately appreciated the allegorical component. *The Alchemist* was a beautiful, if empty, dream.
