Recently I stumbled across a song by Morgan Harper Nichols ft. Jamie Grace called "**Storyteller**". In it, she explains how she is inspired by God's faithfulness to joyfully spread the good news about Jesus (Psalm 77 tells how the psalmist similarly reflects on God's faithfulness to [keep trusting God in difficult circumstances]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2017-08-13-faithfulness-in-hindsight %})).

"Storyteller" is 
- a declaration of God's promise to never abandon his people, 
- a celebration of his faithfulness in fulfilling it, 
- an expression of gratitude for of our God-given ability to describe this amazing blessing to others, 
- and a commitment to obediently do so. 

This song was the catalyst for me setting up this blog, actually. I've had the idea of writing a blog for years but never did anything about it until now. The song helped me realise that telling our stories and expressing our thoughts can also be an act of worship to God.

So here I am, writing a blog on the internet. I hope you hear something meaningful for you in the song too.

> On a Sunday evening I'm looking back  
Over all the years and where I've been.  
Looking at old photographs, I'm remembering  
You were right there and You have been ever since.  
With every page that turns I see Your faithfulness.  
>
> The mountain where I climbed  
The valley where I fell  
You were there all along  
That's the story I'll tell  
You brought the pieces together  
Made me this storyteller  
Now I know it is well, it is well  
That's the story I'll tell
>
> There were some nights that felt like  
They would last forever.
But You kept me breathing  
You were with me right then.  
And all that You have done for me,  
I could never hold it in.  
So here's to me telling this story over and over again.

The valley where I fell  
You were there all along  
That's the story I'll tell  
You brought the pieces together  
Made me this storyteller  
Now I know it is well, it is well  
That's the story I'll tell  
That's the story I'll tell
>
> You hold the broken  
You hear my every cry, every cry  
My eyes are open  
I know that it is well, it is well

The valley where I fell  
You were there all along  
That's the story I'll tell  
You brought the pieces together  
Made me this storyteller  
Now I know it is well, it is well  
That's the story I'll tell  
That's the story I'll tell  
For years and years and years I'll tell  
That's the story I'll tell
