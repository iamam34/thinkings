On Friday night, I joined more than 100 people sleeping out at a local primary school. _14 Hours Homeless_ is an annual event hosted by a number of charities that serve the homeless population in my city. Participants sleep on a couch, in a car, or on a cardboard box to raise awareness and collect sponsorship to support the charities.

We were welcomed at 6pm on Friday with a wristband, a beanie and a cardboard box from Crown Relocations. I picked a spot on the covered verandah and introduced myself to some of the other supporters. They were a diverse bunch: an eleven-year-old boy who had chosen to study homelessness as his school project earlier that year; his mother who had seen a poster and thought it seemed like a good cause; a teenager with her whānau aunties; two older women who felt too old to try sleeping on cardboard but were going to participate by sleeping in their car; a couple of church youth groups; a circle of twenty-somethings from up north "making a weekend of it"; a fourth-year law student; a media and marketing student with a friend from rowing club; a passionate city council worker; and many others. I was surprised by the number of teenagers participating -- it was encouraging to see so many future leaders demonstrating social responsibility. But I was most encouraged by the number of older people participating -- these are our current leaders, who hold power and influence to shape society now, and they care. Among our drop-in guests were a member of parliament, a city councillor, and the mayor.

The event formally began with a mihi whakatau in the school hall. Kāranga and kōrero honoured God as creator and sustainer of everything, acknowledged the history of the area, and thanked the charities hosting us. We responded with the classic waiata _Te Aroha_; the sound of a hundred voices singing in te reo Māori was very meaningful. After a sausage sizzle dinner generously provided by Countdown and the cooked by the Salvation Army, we split into our tour groups to visit some of the charity services nearby. My group wandered down a couple blocks to the soup kitchen and heard its dream of creating community for these people who often suffer from rejection and isolation. The funds raised for the soup kitchen this weekend are going to be used to construct a community garden where the guests can grow food, make art and have an outdoor space of their own to develop social connection. We were also privileged to hear from three men who have been homeless. They taught us: 

> "Treat us like human beings, because that is what we are. Don't tell us to go get a job; it's not that simple when we don't have an address. Why don't _you_ give us a job? And don't feel sorry for us. That doesn't help anyone."

I would have liked to keep the conversation going, but in obedience to the schedule my group headed down the road to the Salvation Army church building. I think we were all struck by the lavish architecture and size of this building compared to the humble soup kitchen. We sat on the polished pews and listened as the head nurse from a health clinic that serves the homeless population in the central city talked about her work. Once upon a time a doctor ran the clinic from the boot of his car. Now the clinic is nurse-led and applies a holistic model of care, working with other services to address patients' physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing. Sometimes the nurses can care for their patients by simply escorting them into a government agency where they have been denied entry, to fill in a form.

We headed back to the school to warm up with delicious pumpkin soup donated by Blue Carrot Catering, shared stories with the other tour groups, and reflected on how fortunate we are. A city councillor encouraged us to call out actions the city could take to address homelessness in our city, and surprised me by explaining they were almost all included in the council's strategy. Half of the participants watched _Hunt for the Wilderpeople_ in the hall and the other half of us headed back to our couch, car, or cardboard to attempt sleep.

The weather was mild and the wind had died down since dinnertime. I ended up next door to a rowdy bunch, but once they settled down and I grew accustomed to my unusual mattress, I slept through the night. I mean, I half-woke a couple of times with cold feet or a squashed arm, but nothing kept me awake for longer than it took to fix.

I awoke to birdsong and clear skies at 6am. Breakfast was weetbix and fruit courtesy of Countdown. The organisers asked us to write a cardboard sign saying one thing we'd learned and pose for a snapshot. And then we had the obligatory group photo, and that was it. 8am: time to head home to our houses and families and jobs and privileged lives. 

As I walked the 20 minutes back to my flat I reflected on the last fourteen hours.

<!-- One girl noted to me after our visit to the church that a sign which read "Put Jesus first" seemed misinformed: given that these people have so many other physical and social needs, they would be better off to put themselves first. Surely, I responded, self-centredness would only accentuate the anti-social behaviours that imprison this demographic? Regardless, I found it ironic that she was advocating self-centredness while participating in a charity fundraising event. -->

_14 Hours Homeless_ was a relatively comfortable event. We had the shelter of a verandah, warm clothes, soup, community, and hope. I felt a little embarrassed asking for sponsorship for such an insignificant trial, to be honest. But fundraising is not about _earning_ money; it's about encouraging others to donate to the causes you care about. On that note, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the generosity of everyone who donated - thank you! Your support is much appreciated and your money will be well spent. 

Before this weekend, I knew very little about the issue homelessness. Now I have heard first-hand from people living on the street. I have listened to the passion of the social workers building community with these people. I am beginning to understand the complexity and scale of the issue, and the web of factors that can render a person homeless -- any of us could lose our home with a quick series of unfortunate events. And most importantly, I can more fully recognise the humanity of the people who find themselves homeless. We are all just people.

While the experience was not particulary realistic, _14 Hours Homeless_ certainly fulfils its purpose: to build understanding about homelessness, and raise money to support the charities that serve the homeless population. I recommend participation to anyone who would like to grow in understanding and contribute to daily needs.

I'll finish with my cardboard sign:
