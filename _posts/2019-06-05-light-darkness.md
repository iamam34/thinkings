Recently I was at a talk that started like this:
 > What is your darkness? Describe it.

I started with words like "despair" and "hopelessness", but the word "underneath" came into my mind and wouldn't be ignored. After getting over the indignation that a measly preposition would claim to be descriptive, I realised it was a gift from God and more insightful of my darkness than any synonym could ever be. I realised I've considered my mind to be substantially darkness covered by a thin layer of light. 

Imagine a deep inky-black pool with an iridescent film over the surface. When I lose hope, the surface dissolves and the substance is revealed for what it is: deep darkness. I must exert effort to hold on to that cloak of light. If my strength fails and I lose the light, everyone will be able to see my darkness for what it is, and to see me for what I am. At the end of my strength I am hopeless and ashamed. Even when do I truly believe and the light is thick, I am still afraid of being found out: if darkness is always lurking underneath, how could I be a "child of the light"? I don't belong in Christ's family because I naturally revert to darkness. That is a lie.

The question of "what are we made of?" is tightly coupled to the doctrine of Total Depravity. This doctrine can be paraphrased as "every human is born into total darkness, and incapable of reaching light without external input". It implies that we can't do good unless we are divinely inspired, and we can't know God unless he first calls us. It would be easy to invoke this doctrine in support of the we-are-made-of-darkness illustration above, but hang on and see where this is going.

When a person becomes a Christian, they are filled with the Holy Spirit. What if light was not a veneer, but a foundation? This is another familiar metaphor but gathers new meaning in contrast. Instead of a liquid pool of darkness, I am a solid block of radiant light (that is, Christ in me). Darkness visits as a smog to smother the light. It is thick, damp and heavy, but it is overcome by the brightness that comes from my core. Darkness is only a nuisance, no longer a threat.

David asks for God's foundational light in his most famous prayer of repentance:
> Create in me a pure heart, O God,
>    and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
> Do not cast me from your presence
>    or take your Holy Spirit from me.
> Restore to me the joy of your salvation
>    and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
> ~Psalm 51:10-12

And Paul talks about it as an age-old mystery, now revealed:
> I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness — the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people. To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
> ~Colossians 1:25-27

Christ is our light. In his own words:
> When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
> ~John 8:12

And as Christians, we are light to others:
> You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
> ~Matthew 5:14-16

Therefore, readers: go and let your light shine.
