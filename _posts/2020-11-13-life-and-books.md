It's been more than a month since I last wrote in this format. To be honest I find it almost impossible to recall the details of each day, since each is so different to the next. I spent a week up north visiting friends and family in Hamilton, Auckland and Palmerston North. I repotted some vegetables and fought back the springtime weeds in our garden. I explored the Botanic Garden and acquired a bicycle on long-term loan from a friend. I spent a day with a puppy and watched the surfers in the bay. I slept a lot. And I also read a few books.


## The Flower Arrangement (Ella Griffin)
From the library; a stroll through the significant moments of each ordinary life. The florist shop at the centre of this tale is a hub of births, deaths and marriages among its regular customers, visitors and staff. What begins as an apparent collection of short stories blossoms into a small-town celebration of the ups and downs of life. It's not all sunshine: split families, unfair deaths and broken marriages all have their time. Indeed, I charge this novel with the crime of a flippant ending after such a courageous journey. If you can forgive that, the rest of it is a good read.

Comparing this view of the world with my own, I was struck by its almost religious commitment to the ordained stages of life: first love, disappointment, marriage, birth, death. If you saw the world through the chiming door of a florist shop, so might it appear. While I am beginning to recognise the incomparable significance of love over all other modes of being, I have yet to concede such significance to these particular events. At least I can agree that marriage and children are not guarantees of happiness, and a life need not be happy to be good. 

_The Flower Arrangement_ helped to develop my understanding of life's journey according to the mainstream secular viewpoint, and grow in empathy for those mysterious people who attach significance to flowers.

## The History of Bees (Maja Lunde)
This award-winning novel paints an unsettlingly true-to-life picture of the necessity of bees, and their imminent decline towards extinction. The ordinary human lives of William in 1852 England, George in 2007 USA, and Tao in 2078 China are skilfully woven together across time and space (the novel was published in 2014) to form a prophecy which becomes deeply personal to each reader. While the people and their dysfunctional families are fiction, the bee-related events (invention of a new hive for observation and honey-harvesting, unexplained colony failures, hand-pollination by human workers) are historically accurate -- truth is stranger than fiction. 

[Colony collapse disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder) is an unexplained phenomenon wherein the majority of worker bees suddenly abandon a hive. It appears to be  correlated with a wide range of stressors including pesticides, poor nutrition, disease, and genetic factors. Read the wikipedia page for your daily dose of real-world dystopia.

I experienced this novel as an audiobook rented through the Libby app using my local library account. I highly recommend the system (who wants to _buy_ an audiobook?) but I admit that I disagreed with the readers' interpretation of the words. All three readers (for William, George and Tao) made it sound like every moment was the end of the world: intense and despairing. Often halfway through a sentence I would think to myself, "If I were reading it, that observation would carry wry humour -- not dejection!" The constantly high intensity exhausted me as a listener and I had to take many breaks which interrupted the flow of the narrative. It was excellent writing, poorly read.

## Sensible Shoes (Sharon Garlough Brown)
This was undoubtedly the most influential book I read this month. I borrowed it from a friend after hearing good things about it from CBA and other sources earlier this year. Like _The History of Bees_, its mode is fictional characters interacting with real-world knowledge. In this case we follow four diverse American women as they attend the Saturday morning sessions of a course on (Christian) Spiritual Disciplines. Along the way their various attitudes of scepticism and anxiety are replaced with deep honest friendships and mentoring relationships. 

I was surprised and delighted to identify myself with all four of the women in spite of their differences. I was even more encouraged by the similarities between the events in the book and my personal experiences: I was reading about the same God. With neither thunderous miracles nor any audible voice, God speaks to each of the women. Hannah, a servant-hearted workaholic pastor, hears God say that "the flowers are for _you_." Mara, unwanted throughout her sad childhood and marriage, hears "I choose you." Meg, lonely and alone, hears "I got you; keep comin'." And Charissa, perfect to a fault of blindness, hears "It's not an exam; it's a journey hand-in-hand with me". 

This book inspired me to draw a prayer labyrinth in chalk on our backyard; write a letter I will never send; and start meeting with a mentor for Spiritual Direction. Although admittedly slanted towards the "American Christian woman" vernacular and context, I recommend this to all who are willing to suspend their disbelief and give it a shot. 

## Till We Have Faces (C.S. Lewis)
_Till We Have Faces_ retells the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, with several significant alterations, through the first-person narration of Psyche's older sister Maia. I have been looking for this book for months -- ever since I heard that it presents a more developed female character than the disappointing mousey-wifey of Lewis's earlier novel _Out of the Silent Planet_. Having finally found a copy to borrow (from my pastor, of all people!) I set about reading it with an open mind.

Firstly, I can confirm that Lewis' female characters are significantly more nuanced in this story than in _Out of the Silent Planet_. Nevertheless, I was disappointed to note that his two leading ladies simply represent feminine and masculine forms of womanhood. One is beautiful and generous, pure and faultless. The other is ugly... we hear she is not considered as a woman by her trusted advisors nor her subjects. She is therefore free to grow in knowledge and wisdom, learning to fight, ride a horse, and excel in the sly diplomacy of kingship. I resent Lewis's implication that women are confined by external opinions. But I understand his argument. This novel was not written as a treatise on womanhood; it is an exploration of faith. 

I will not spoil it for you. Let me say merely that the chief question surrounds the nature of faith and the corresponding place of reason. Another major theme is the morality of love in all its shades of generosity and desire. Lewis posits his theories in general terms, omitting any overtly Christian imagery. He takes a myth and writes a masterpiece of question. And oh, what an ending!

## The Trivia Man (Deborah O'Brien)
As expected, this novel was a light-hearted celebration of neurodiversity with a romance signalled in chapter three and fulfilled happily-ever-after in chapter fifteen. Compared to other novels in the "autistic middle-aged person discovers happiness" genre (e.g. _The Rosie Project_, _Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine_), this is less immersive and more observational since it is narrated in the third-person. The unnamed disorder is also less debilitating: Kevin is a relatively high-functioning member of society. In summary it is a low-effort holiday read with the requisite happy ending. Nothing spectacular.

## Ready Player One (Ernest Cline)
I'm only about a quarter of the way through this one. I borrowed it as an e-book through the Libby app and my local library. I've tried reading e-books before. It's not my favourite activity... but it's better than waiting years for a hardcopy. So far I'm enjoying it even though I recognise very few of the pop culture references. Apparently Steven Spielberg's movie is worth a watch, but I always prefer to read the book beforehand with a pure imagination. So here I am on p282 of 800. I was going to read more this afternoon but decided to write this list of reviews instead. You're welcome.
