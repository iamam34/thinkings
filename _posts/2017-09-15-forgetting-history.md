Four days ago on Monday was the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center bombing. Although I can't say I remember the shock of that tragedy myself, people tell me that it was the catalyst for America's war on terrorism. And for as long as I can remember, the United States of America -- freedom's poster child -- has been increasingly defensive of its borders, with a focus on predominantly Muslim countries. In March this year President Trump [signed an executive order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/travel-ban-muslim-trump.html) that restricts entry to the USA from Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria, or Libya.

But the thing that stood out to me this year on 9/11 was that nobody mentioned it. Maybe I neglected to watch the news or read the paper this time around -- maybe our journalists are still on the case. But perhaps it's fading from memory; we don't immediately recall the significance of that event. We are forgetting what the world was like before the West became afraid of terrorism.

Tonight I watched [_That Bloody Woman_](http://tourmakers.co.nz/show/that-bloody-woman/), a rock musical about the life and work of Kate Sheppard. Kate's legacy is that in 1893 (that's 120 years ago) New Zealand became the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote. The narrative explores family, friendships, and romance together with activism, patriarchy, and politics to weave a rich context for Kate's achievement. It's a social commentary that challenges us to appreciate the rights we take for granted, acknowledge that social oppression continues in new guises, and most importantly resolve to set things right.

I'll admit, I didn't mention the 9/11 bombing to anyone on Monday. It's an awkward topic to raise.

> "Hey, I just remembered that today's the anniversary of that bombing that started the whole anti-Muslim thing."

But I'd argue it's worth it. 

Let's keep commemorating tragedies and celebrating victories, _especially_ when we don't remember them personally. If we pretend history never happened, we'll forget that the world can change. We'll begin to doubt whether we can make any difference. But the 9/11 hijackers changed the world. Trump changed the world. And Kate changed the world. 

History actually happened, remember?
