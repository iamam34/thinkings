We met about 7pm on Friday after work at Wellington train station. The first thing we had to do was decide whether to attempt a Southern Crossing. The forecast of typical Tararua rain and gale had improved to include a window of drizzle and breeze. We considered our plans B and C and D, then chose the “more hardcore” option A. 

The second thing to do was dinner. We grabbed takeaways and headed to Kaitoke, where we planned to emerge on Sunday, to drop off a car. Another hour or so brought us to Otaki Forks and we finally started walking at 10.30pm. The track was wide and well-marked, and the sky was wet. Cathy lost a purple merino buff on our first layer stop, and Sam discovered his torch didn't like the rain. Onwards we boldly plodded to reach an empty Field Hut about 1.30am. No time to light the fire, but a luxurious hot chocolate revived our spirits and we crawled into our sleeping bags for what was left of the night. 

Saturday morning heralded a grand brunch of pancakes, banana and bacon. The intermittent downpours overnight had largely passed. A fellow traveller arrived from the roadend about 11am and agreed that a tops crossing was definitely looking possible. And so: up we went to the tops. We found giant worms and vegetable sheep and īnanga (turpentine).

Kime Hut was a welcome refuge for lunch (30 min to eat and 20 min to get out the door!). On the summit of Mt Hector Cathy led us in a laundry-themed victory dance: this work of artistic genius included such moves as “hanging out the towels”. The laundry theme continued in each stumble as we ascended and descended the Beehives and travelled around the great Dress Circle. The Tararua tops rewarded us with a view of the inside of a cloud, just enough visibility to spot the next waratah track marker, the whole day from Tabletop until Mt Alpha. On the approach to Alpha the clouds suddenly parted and we were delighted to identify Bull Mound, Cone, False Spur, and the Wairarapa plain. As the sun faded, the moon came out to play and we reached Alpha Hut by torchlight shortly after 7pm and just before the rain set in. The forecasted weather window was right on time, and we had made it through.

> Let all that I am praise the Lord.

> O Lord my God, how great you are!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are robed with honor and majesty.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are dressed in a robe of light.  
You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds.  
You make the clouds your chariot;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;you ride upon the wings of the wind.  
The winds are your messengers;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;flames of fire are your servants.

> _Psalm 104:1-4 (NLT)_

The fire which we had been looking forward to all day stayed alight for less than the hour it took to start it and David graciously submitted to this entropic universe. Cathy's dinner was nutritious and warm, Sam's canned blackberries were sweet and delicious, and we soon drifted off to a well-earned sleep about 10pm.

The alarm went off at 8am on Sunday. Muesli and puddings for breakfast and we were ready to go by 9.30am. After conquering Hells Gate and Omega we expected a long but straightforward stroll down Marchant Ridge. It turned out to be several nautical miles of goblin forest: beautiful but undeniably soggy. We passed the time by "boasting in each other". A quick lunch in the drizzle, a few more laundry-related manoeuvres on the slippery clay, some pop psychology, a brief period in thin scrub to remind us of the gale above the treeline, and a burning orange sunset between the layers of cloud brought us to Kaitoke roadend at 7pm.

As we drove back to Otaki Forks via the Turkish Kebab shop we reflected on our weekend. We had walked for 20 hours of a 48-hour period through beech, tops, and mud. The mountains make us feel small in a good way. Praise God for the epic adventure!
