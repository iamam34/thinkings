I've read a few books over the last few months, and I'd like to take some time to share my impressions with you, dear audience.

# The Kainnan Chronicles (Belinda Stott)
**Tags:** fiction, young adult, Christianity, romance, adventure, mystery, save-the-world, mental health

I met Belinda when I attended her Christian young adult mental wellbeing course, Soul Tour, in July 2018. Her writing is clearly a passion project and exudes her own personality: excitable, improvement-obsessed and idealistic. Each novel in the series follows a character's personal journey with self-image and relational skills in the context of a run-for-your-lives adventure mystery. I identified myself with two of the female protagonists and found their journeys helpful to my own.

Personally, I felt that the pace could have benefitted from some quieter moments (apart from stolen kisses) -- is cliffhanger fatigue a thing? The prose had some medieval quirks e.g. "for" instead of "because" but was otherwise unremarkable. 

I started the Kainnan series out of curiosity and finished it with a mixture of pleasure and frustration. This would be lightweight wholesome fluff if not for its teenage swoon factor.

# Praying the Psalms (Walter Brueggemann)
**Tags:** non-fiction, theology, pastoral, Bible, scripture, psalms, Christianity, Judaism, poetry

This was a graduation present from the staff of the Venn residential fellowship. I had mentioned that I would love to understand more about the Christian practice of praying the Psalms, and this was the resource they recommended.

Brueggemann selects six of the most obvious "tricky questions" and sets out a brief but robust theology of how and why to pray the Psalms as part of the Christian life. The first half is an invitation to recognise the metaphorical qualities of the language. Tears represent all pain; the table represents all feast experiences; the pit is set against the mountain. In the second half of the book, Brueggemann turns our attention to the "awkward Jewishness" of the Psalms with particular attention to the cultural context for speeches of vengeance. 

This book was medicine for my attitude to the Psalms. It taught me to approach with reverence and gratitude this collection of divinely-inspired poetry. It gave me permission to read my personal experience into the metaphors of pain and celebration, and addressed my uncertainty about Zion and calls for vengeance. 

In short, I appreciate this gift and recommend this book to all.

# Yates Green Guide to Gardening (Allen Gilbert)
_A no fuss guide to organic gardening_

**Tags:** non-fiction, guidebook, instructional, gardening, organic

Written in 1991, this informative guide is a relic from before the internet. It takes a meandering tour through the world of organic gardening -- the list of plants to grow is withheld until chapter five! As well as the slower pace, another sign of its era is the repeated recommendation to use discarded plastic film and sheeting as an "eco-friendly" alternative to buying new materials. Now gladwrap is blacklisted and plastic bags are sold for a premium. How times have changed!

Vegetables, however, have not changed much in thirty years. As a novice, I appreciated the descriptions of each plant and its preferred environment. I learned which pairs grow well together and what can harm or repair the soil. I was encouraged by the generations of backyard gardeners who have gone before me and inspired to join them in our collective quest to change the world, one potato at a time.

# In the Same Boat (Kitty Barnes)
**Tags:** fiction, chapter book, children, wartime, England, Poland, boarding school

This is one of my old favourites. Eleven-year-old girls Bridget (English) and Antosia (Polish) become best friends in a lifeboat after their ship is torpedoed. Antosia (Tossie) adds unimaginable passion and energy to Bridget's very English world as they navigate grumpy housekeepers, strict school mistresses, cosy grandmothers, and wonderfully wild Polish uncles. 

It's a comfortable tale of everything right with the world (even against the backdrop of a world war). In many ways it captures the essence of childhood innocence. It reminds me to accept challenges, care deeply, and let my whole self be fully alive in this wonderful big world. Highly recommended.

# Another Bulls**t Night in Suck City (Nick Flynn)
**Tags:** non-fiction, memoir, homelessness, father, son, drugs, alcohol, addiction, family

If this was fiction, it would break my heart. As a memoir, it is devastating. The author weaves snippets of sharp prose across time and place and person to present himself as the son of a homeless man. Although the story appears to revolve around his father, the author is the subject of this deeply personal battle of identity. He resents the expectation that he ought to help this man who has given him nothing beyond genes. He resents the patterns of addiction, mental illness and dysfunction which repeat down the generations of his heritage.

> Brothers and sisters I have none,
> But that man's father is my father's son.

As a Christian I was particularly affected by the mention of Noah and Ham. For the sin of seeing his father Noah drunk and naked, Ham and all his descendants are cursed by God. Nick Flynn sees only hateful injustice in that curse as he carries the memory of seeing his own drunk and naked father. He also carries the guilt of Ham, doing nothing to help. Nick refuses to forgive his father and is trapped in resentment forever.

This memoir sits heavy in my soul. I can only make sense of it by acknowledging the need for forgiveness and infinite second chances. I refuse to finish in Nick's resignation, because I believe Jesus is good news for the oppressed and the broken-hearted. As surely as my God lives, there is _always_ hope. This story of unsurmountable injustice calls me out of my comfort zone towards truly sacrificial love. Give me your heart, Lord.

# Gregg Shorthand Simplified for Colleges (Leslie, Zoubek and Hosler)
**Tags:** non-fiction, shorthand, textbook, alphabet

One of my new flatmates learned Gregg Shorthand for transcription and now uses it for writing personal journals. I've always been intrigued by languages and alternative alphabets, so I've known of shorthand for many years. But this is the first time I've had access to a textbook and a tutor to guide the way.

I'm only three lessons in but I have already learned the vast majority of sounds. Gregg is a type of shorthand that records words phonetically. For example, the English word "heightened" would be recorded as "hÄ«tnd". If you want to see what the actual shorthand looks like, search online for "Gregg shorthand". Each sound is a line fragment, so each word looks like a squiggle of varying loops and waves. I'm very slow but I'm improving with practice. 

Like the gardening book and In the Same Boat, this 1950s textbook is full of delightful anachronisms. One of the sentences given for reading practice was "Jim has a bad habit; he smokes in bed. He might start a fire." Aside from pure entertainment, the unfamiliar statements have a pedagogical benefit: I can't cheat by guessing!

In the long-term I aspire to journal like my flatmate, but I'm not convinced I possess sufficient determination. I'm enjoying the brain exercise of learning shorthand in this season of life where challenge is precious.
