Oftentimes I find myself feeling betrayed by God. I have a (completely unfounded) sense of entitlement to divine guidance... so when I don't know what to do, I blame God for abandoning me. Many years have taught me that God loves me, and God cares about me, and God promises to live in everyone who believes and trusts in him. But sometimes, I don't believe a word of it. When life is tough I cry out to God: "Help -- why don't you care?!".

[Psalm 77](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+77) shows a godly reaction to difficult circumstances.

First, Asaph the psalmist describes the same cry to God: "Help -- why don't you care?!". 

> Has his unfailing love vanished forever?  
Has his promise failed for all time?  
Has God forgotten to be merciful?  
Has he in anger withheld his compassion?  
_Psalm 77:8-9 (NIVUK)_

Interestingly, he never doubts God's existence or power. God exists, and God can make anything happen. What the psalmist questions is God's _faithfulness_.

And then, after expressing all this anguish -- at his lowest point -- the psalmist stops to reflect on the past. Asaph recalls God's principal demonstration of love and power: when Israel escaped Egypt. All 700+ descendants of Jacob walked through the Red Sea on dry ground, and Pharaoh's army couldn't catch them. This event is a pretty big deal already, but the context makes it even more significant.

In brief: God promised Abram (an old man with no kids) that his descendants would become a nation of people more numerous than the stars in the sky. The first step was that Abram/Abraham had a son called Isaac, despite him and his wife being about 100 years old. Isaac grew up and had a son called Jacob/Israel, and Jacob/Israel had twelve sons including one called Joseph. Joseph's brothers hated him and sold him into slavery, then his master put him in prison, then he correctly interpreted a few dreams and ended up as Pharaoh's second-in-command at the top of the Egyptian empire (all this makes for a fascinating biography). Then there was a huge famine and Joseph's brothers (who thought he was dead) came to Egypt begging for food. Joseph forgave them and invited all his family to live in Egypt, and life was good. Then time continued on, several Pharaohs lived and died, and Jacob's descendants became slaves to the Egyptian empire. At this point it looked like God had forgotten his promise to Abraham, or changed his mind, or given up, or failed. Abraham's descendants were not looking like a nation.

And now we come to arguably the biggest event in the Old Testament: God uses a stuttering coward called Moses to challenge Pharaoh, perform miracles, and lead the slaves out of captivity. All 600,000+ descendants of Jacob walked through the Red Sea on dry ground, and Pharaoh's army couldn't catch them.

Asaph sees that God chose to use his power to rescue his people and fulfil his promise to Abraham. And God has proven to be faithful over and over again in Israel's history. By remembering God's faithfulness, the psalmist's anguish is replaced with peace and trust in God. If slavery to the Egyptian empire is just one step in the process of God fulfilling his promises, then surely Asaph's current distress is nothing to worry about.

Next time I'm feeling abandoned by God, I'll try to remember to reflect on his faithfulness in the past. There's loads of records in the Bible of God exercising his power to help his nation Israel and to encourage the first Christians. There's loads of stories of God's goodness to his people today, too. Christian testimonies are powerful stuff, I'm tellin' ya. But that's another topic for another day. 

The biggest reassurance of God's love for me (and you, and all humankind) is this: after 1000+ years of promising a saviour for the world, God came to live with us (as a man called Jesus) and allowed us to _kill_ him, suffering the punishment that we deserve. And he rose to life again, conquering our failure to be perfect and making it possible for us imperfect creatures to have a personal _intimate_ relationship with God, the holy creator and owner of the universe. That's how I know God loves me, and how I know he loves you: because Easter happened. 

God is loving and powerful and faithful to his promises. Look to history for the evidence.
