Last week I finished two books. 

The first is a modern (2018?) self-published novel by Belinda Stott entitled _Redemption_ (fourth of five books in the _Kainnan_ series). I read it cover-to-cover in about five hours. As with the other _Kainnan_ books, it was light and pleasant for as long as I could ignore its crimes against English grammar and the art of weaving a story. I appreciate the way it presents emotional health as an important, difficult and ultimately hopeful part of our shared humanity. The characters experience God's presence in an unfamiliar thought at just the right time; and in meaningful dreams. Occasionally they receive an unannounced visit from Jesus himself.

The second is a slightly older (1996) epic novel by Stephen Lawhead called _Byzantium_. I've been reading it chapter-by-chapter for the last twelve months or so. Structurally, the novel follows an Irish monk on pilgrimage to Byzantium in the medieval Dark Ages. The adventure of trying to stay alive provides sufficient excitement for every chapter to fill a novel of its own! But the power of the story for me lies in its theological undercurrent. 

The protagonist Aidan has lived all his life in a remote monastery observing daily rhythms of prayer and agriculture, and scribing copies of the Holy Scripture. The monks experience God's presence through unfamiliar thoughts at just the right time; and in meaningful dreams. He tries to ignore his selfishness in wanting an opportunity to see the world: pilgrimage is a form of holy devotion to God alone. But he is overjoyed when he is selected for the honour of joining the party travelling to Byzantium. Through a dream he learns that he will die in Byzantium. Upon reaching mainland Europe, the pilgrims are attacked by pirates and Aidan is enslaved to Gunnar, a kindly Danish barbarian who soon becomes one of Aidan's greatest friends. Aidan does eventually reach the great city... but he lives to leave it! Aidan accuses God of spurning his willing sacrifice: he was prepared to die a martyr, and God didn't accept the gift. Living a life without God is much harder than dying a martyr. His bitterness develops into revenge and then despair. He tells his brother monks that God has ceased to care for this world; prayer is a waste of breath that could better be spent in action. "If anything good is to come of this world, we must do it ourselves," is Aidan's attitude. But the climax (at least in my reading) comes when Aidan and Gunnar are reunited. Now Aidan is faithless, feeling utterly abandoned by God. But Gunnar the barbarian has received the gospel. Gunnar teaches Aidan with conviction: in Jesus, Emmanuel "God-with-us" suffered betrayal, injustice, pain, and even death.

I couldn't help but compare the ways God is portrayed in _Byzantium_ and _Kainnan_. 

These authors are novelists, not theologians. C.S. Lewis, who is both, presents a remarkably similar image of Jesus in his 1945 novel _That Hideous Strength_ (third in the space trilogy). Mr. Fisher-King is a man, all dignity and all kindness, radiating light, experiencing pain, and he speaks as a person to a person. Lewis' protagonist, Jane, observes his voice:

> And the voice also seemed to be like sunlight and gold, like gold not only as gold is beautiful but as it is heavy: like sunlight not only as it falls gently on English walls in autumn but as it beats down on the jungle or the desert to engender life or destroy it. And now it was addressing her.

I wish Jesus visited me as he visits the characters of Kainnan. I wish I could visit him as Jane does. But I feel a greater affinity for Gunnar the faithful Dane who delights in simple childlike trust that God is good, and present.

A few weeks ago was Easter, the ultimate commemoration of God's pain and understanding (among other things!). The church calendar leads us to reflect on the story of Thomas meeting Jesus shortly afterwards. Jesus welcomes Thomas's questions and offers his wounds as evidence of his identity. As Thomas exclaims in faith and obedience, "My Lord and my God!" Jesus offers a blessing to us who can only read of such encounters.

May God enable us to love and serve him faithfully, for the rest of our lives.

> You love him even though you have never seen him. Though you do not see him now, you trust him; and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy. The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls. (NLT)

> Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls. (NIV)
